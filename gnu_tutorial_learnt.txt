Signal Source - SampleRate can be set based on requirement using a variable if required. (  In signal processing, sampling is the reduction of a continuous signal to a discrete signal. A common example is the conversion of a sound wave (a continuous signal) to a sequence of samples (a discrete-time signal). )
