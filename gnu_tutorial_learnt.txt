Signal Source - SampleRate can be set based on requirement using a variable if required. (  In signal processing, sampling is the reduction of a continuous signal to a discrete signal. A common example is the conversion of a sound wave (a continuous signal) to a sequence of samples (a discrete-time signal). )

Setting the Marker to Dot Large shows the actual sample values collected in the form of dots ( it is directly related to the sample rate set - Ex: If the sampling rate was 32Khz ==>> 32000 samples/second = 32 samples/ms. 


FFT plot is Power(dB) (Y-axis) again Frequency(kHz)

Decimation decreases the number of samples that
are processed. A decimation factor of two means that the output of the filter will have a
sample rate equal to one-half of the input sample rate
