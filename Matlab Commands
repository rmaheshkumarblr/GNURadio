addpath('/home/furonics/gnuradio/gr-utils/octave') %Load the matlab location library to read complex output of FFT
data_oct = read_complex_binary('/home/furonics/GNURadio/droneMove.dat') %Read the complex output of FFT
amplitude = abs(data_oct) %Calculate the amplitude of the output
Fs = 20 * 10^6 % Sampling Rate of 20 MHz
T = 1/Fs % Time period of capture
L = length(amplitude) %Capturing the size as input.
t = (0:L-1)*T %Creating x axis with time as required based on input size
plot(t,amplitude) %Plotting graph of amplitude across time.
